Using Form-Based Login in JavaServer Faces Web Applications

================================================================================

A managed bean can authenticate users of a JavaServer Faces application, which 
allows regular Facelets form tags to be used instead of a mix of standard HTML 
and Facelets tags. In this case, the managed bean defines login and logout 
methods, and Facelets forms call these methods in the action attribute. The 
managed beanâ€™s methods call the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.login and 
HttpServletRequest.logout methods to manage user authentication.


Using the JDBC Realm for User Authentication

================================================================================

An authentication realm, sometimes called a security policy domain or security 
domain, is a scope over which an application server defines and enforces a 
common security policy. A realm contains a collection of users, who may or may 
not be assigned to a group. GlassFish Server comes preconfigured with the file, 
certificate, and administration realms. An administrator can also set up LDAP, 
JDBC, digest, or custom realms.

An application can specify in its deployment descriptor which realm to use. If 
the application does not specify a realm, GlassFish Server uses its default 
realm, the file realm. If an application specifies that a JDBC realm is to be 
used for user authentication,GlassFish Server will retrieve user credentials 
from a database. The application server uses the database information and the 
enabled JDBC realm option in the configuration file.
